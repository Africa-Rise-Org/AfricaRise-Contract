# AfricaRise-Contract
WHY AFRICA RISE TOKEN
Africa is a continent comprising of 54 unique and distinct countries, but they have very common issues. This coin seeks to help that continent out.

### Reflections
Every hour we’re rewarding hodlers with BNB by just buying and holding. Unlike other coins that reflect immediately, we’re incentivizing people with diamond hands to hold a little longer.

### Burn and Rise
Africa Rise is using an advanced new DeFi tokenomics with a next generation buy-back and burn system and while at the same time helping both users and Africa as a continent. This is not another burn coin. Every transaction, we purchase the tokens from the open pool and then burn them permanently, which results in a price bounce each time.

### Charity
This is a community driven token and 10% of the entire float is dedicated towards giving to charitable causes. Additionally, 1% of each transaction will go to a liquid pool for these donations.
